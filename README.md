ğŸ”¥ Torch it Up - ML Challenge: Handwritten Mathematical Symbol Classification
=============================================================================

Handwritten mathematical symbols play a crucial role in academic and industrial applications, includingÂ OCR systems, digital note-taking, and assistive technologies. However, recognizing handwritten symbols remains a challenging task due toÂ variations in writing styles, distortions, and noise.

This competition challenges participants to developÂ a robust machine learning modelÂ capable of accurately classifyingÂ handwritten mathematical symbolsÂ from the Provided dataset. The dataset containsÂ 168,236 grayscale images (32Ã—32 pixels) spanning 369 unique classes, covering a broad range of mathematical notation.

Participants will train their models using aÂ labeled dataset of handwritten symbolsÂ and submit predictions for anÂ unlabeled test set. The goal is toÂ achieve the highest accuracyÂ on the private test set.
